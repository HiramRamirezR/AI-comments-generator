# Project Action Plan: Automatic Social Media Comment Generator

## Mentor Role

**Objective:** The AI assistant (Gemini) will act as a mentor. Instead of writing code directly, it will provide step-by-step explanations, guidance, and code examples to help the user learn and implement the features themselves.

## Project Status

The architectural refactoring is complete. The application now consists of a separate FastAPI backend that serves the language model and a Streamlit frontend that consumes the API. The end-to-end functionality has been tested and verified locally.

## Current Position

We have successfully completed the separation of the frontend and backend. The next logical step is to begin the **Refinement** phase, focusing on improving the user experience and the quality of the generated comments.

## Completed Steps

- **Architectural Refactoring**: 
  - Separated the application into a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit frontend.
  - The frontend now communicates with the backend via HTTP requests.
  - Successfully tested the full client-server communication locally.

## Next Steps

1.  **Refinement:**
    *   Refine the UI/UX based on the testing feedback.
    *   Continue to improve the prompt engineering in `src/generator.py` for better results.

2.  **Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces:**
    *   Create a new Space on Hugging Face.
    *   Configure the Space to run both the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend.
    *   Deploy the application to make it publicly accessible.

3.  **Final Documentation:**
    *   Update the `README.md` with a link to the live application and instructions on how to use the API.
    *   Add any additional documentation or notes.
