# Project Action Plan: Automatic Social Media Comment Generator

## Project Status

So far, we have successfully completed the initial development phase of the project. The following milestones have been achieved:

*   **Project Scaffolding:** The basic folder structure (`src`, `requirements.txt`) has been created.
*   **Dependencies:** All the necessary Python libraries (`streamlit`, `transformers`, `torch`) have been defined.
*   **Core Logic:** The comment generation logic has been implemented in `src/generator.py`. It uses the `distilgpt2` model to generate multiple comment options.
*   **Utilities:** A utility function to manage available tones has been created in `src/utils.py`.
*   **User Interface:** A user-friendly web interface has been built with Streamlit in `src/main.py`. The interface allows users to input text, select a tone, and generate comments.
*   **Documentation:** A `README.md` file with project information has been created.

## Current Position

We are currently at the **testing and validation** stage. The application is fully coded and ready to be run locally for the first time. The next immediate action is to run the `streamlit run src/main.py` command to test the end-to-end functionality.

## Next Steps

1.  **Local Testing and Debugging:**
    *   Thoroughly test the application with different inputs and tones.
    *   Identify and fix any bugs or unexpected behavior.
    *   Evaluate the quality of the generated comments and decide if the `distilgpt2` model is sufficient or if we should try a more powerful model like `gpt2-medium`.

2.  **Refinement:**
    *   Refine the UI/UX based on the testing feedback.
    *   Improve the prompt engineering in `src/generator.py` to get even better results.

3.  **Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces:**
    *   Create a new Space on Hugging Face.
    *   Configure the Space to use our application code and dependencies.
    *   Deploy the application to make it publicly accessible.

4.  **Final Documentation:**
    *   Update the `README.md` with a link to the live application.
    *   Add any additional documentation or notes.
